The Clockwork plugins depends on a specific of Solana _(for know we recommend that you use the exact same version)_.
Make sure your Solana validator uses the same version as Clockwork by installing it again if needed `solana-install init x.y.z`.

- If for some reason you cannot install the same version, please talk to us.
