# Use-cases

Clockwork automations massively expands the design space for blockchain developers. Below is a list of use-cases developers are using threads to build today:

### Games

* **Dynamic worlds** – Create dynamic, interactive game worlds where events can happen \*to\* your users.&#x20;
* **Idle games** – Setup automated schedules for idle game worlds such as automatically regrowing trees, building construction times, and dinner visitors.&#x20;

* **LP rebalancing** – Automatically rebalance liquidity on AMMs like [**Orca**](https://www.orca.so/) whenever the market price moves out of a specified range.

### Payments

* **Scheduled payments** – Schedule token transfers and automate payroll or subscription payments.
* **Dollar-cost averaging** – Run an automated dollar-cost averaging program on-chain to ease into an investment position without hassle or stress. &#x20;
* **Auto-claim yield** – Automatically claim and distribute yield from your favorite validator or defi application.&#x20;

### Oracles

* **Statistics** – Calculate stats, moving averages, volatility indices and more from oracle data feeds.
