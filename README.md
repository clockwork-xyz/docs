# Introduction

**Clockwork** **is an open-source automation engine for the** [**Solana**](https://solana.com/) **blockchain**. Developers can use Clockwork to schedule transactions and build automated, event-driven smart-contracts.&#x20;

### **Blockchains**

**Blockchains represent a major paradigm shift in software engineering.** Where applications are traditionally hosted in large centrally managed data centers, blockchains like Solana offer an alternative computing environment â€“ one that's run by a decentralized community of stakeholders.&#x20;

On a blockchain, computing is secured by smart-contracts and data is automatically replicated to thousands of servers around the world. This helps makes information transparent to users and tamperproof from malicious actors. These qualities make blockchains an ideal choice for applications where cryptographically-secured truth is important.&#x20;

### Why Solana?

**Solana is the most performant and scalable public blockchain in the world.** With its affordable fees, snappy transactions, and globally distributed validator network, Solana is a favorite amongst users and developers alike. Currently humming along at [**\~40,000,000**](https://dune.com/kroeger0x/Solana-Metrics) transactions per day, Solana processes more transactions than many other notable blockchains combined. And with over [**2,000**](https://solana.com/news/validator-health-report-august-2022) validators on six different continents around the world, Solana is by many metrics one the most decentralized blockchains in the world.
