# Introduction

**Clockwork** **is an open-source automation engine for the** [**Solana**](https://solana.com/) **blockchain**. Developers can use Clockwork to schedule transactions and securely automate decentralized workflows.

## **Background**

**Blockchains represent a major paradigm shift in software engineering.** Where traditionally an application is hosted in a large centrally-managed datacenter, blockchains like Solana offer an alternative computing environment – one that's maintained by a decentralized community of stakeholders.&#x20;

On a blockchain, program state can be efficiently copied to thousands of nodes around the world – making information both more transparent to the world and durable in storage. Blockchain nodes can efficiently distribute downtime risk across many independent datacenters, providing more reliable uptime than relying on a single dedicated server!

### Solana

**Solana is the most active blockchain in the world.** Its affordable fees, low-latency messaging, and scalable architecture make it an ideal choice for users and developers alike. Processing an average of 40,000,000 non-vote transactions per day, Solana has more on-chain activity than every other notable blockchain combined. And with over 3,400 validators powering the network ([**source**](https://solana.com/news/validator-health-report-august-2022)), Solana is measurably one of the most decentralized blockchains in the world.

### Decentralization

**Decentralization is core to everything we do in crypto.** It's the fundamental principle that supports values like network security, censorship resistance, and permissionless computing.&#x20;

The funny thing is, decentralization has always __ been __ a core principle of the Internet. It was only in recent years that this has become much less true. Today, the vast majority of Internet communications flow through just a small handful of companies. This centralization has generally made markets and services that depend on the Internet less secure and more susceptible to censorship.&#x20;

This is why we work in crypto – to build systems that help people live their lives _independently from_ and _collaboratively with_ one another. The design space is enormous and we're excited by all the things we see others building in the space everyday.

### The automation dilemma

Despite the innovations blockchains provide over traditional data centers, they are not a wholesale replacement for the entire application stack. One critical use-case not supported by blockchains today are **lambdas**, automated code that can run without a dedicated server.&#x20;

This creates a problem for decentralization because it forces developers to fallback on centralized solutions to automate on-chain applications. A dapp is only as decentralized as its most centralized dependency! We call this problem **"the automation dilemma"** – when a developer must choose between _automation or decentralization_ in a system they are building.

## Why Clockwork?&#x20;

We believe an open-source blockchain automation engine will be important for unlocking the next big wave of decentralized applications. By building public tooling and developer infrastructure, we hope to support teams of all kinds in their journeys rebuilding the games and markets of the new global Internet.&#x20;
