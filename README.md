# Introduction

**Clockwork** **is an open-source automation engine for the** [**Solana**](https://solana.com/) **blockchain**. Developers can use Clockwork to schedule transactions and automate smart-contracts without relying on centralized infrastructure.

## **Background**

**Blockchains represent a major paradigm shift in software engineering.** Where applications are traditionally hosted in large centrally managed data centers, blockchains like Solana offer an alternative computing environment â€“ one that's run by a decentralized community of stakeholders.&#x20;

On a blockchain, data is automatically copied to thousands of servers around the world at the speed of light. This helps makes (unencrypted) information transparent and tamperproof for users. This quality gives blockchains to a unique strength for applications were cryptographically-secured truth is important.&#x20;

Despite the many innovations blockchains provide, they are not yet a wholesale replacement for your traditional application stack.

### Solana

**Solana is the fastest public blockchain in the world.** With its affordable fees, snappy transactions, and globally distributed validator network, Solana is a favorite amongst users and developers alike. Currently humming around [**\~40,000,000**](https://dune.com/kroeger0x/Solana-Metrics) transactions per day, Solana processes more transactions than many other notable blockchains combined. And with over [**2,000**](https://solana.com/news/validator-health-report-august-2022) validators on six different continents around the world, Solana is by many metrics one the most decentralized blockchains in the world.

### Why Clockwork?&#x20;

We believe developers should be able to easily schedule transactions and build event-driven programs without having to maintain expensive off-chain infrastructure.
