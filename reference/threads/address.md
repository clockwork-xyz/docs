# Address

A thread's **public address** is derived deterministically from its `authority` and `id`. These properties are immutable and may never change throughout the lifetime of the thread account. To verify a Clockwork thread account in your programs, you can use the `pubkey()` helper function provided by the SDK:

```rust
#[account(
    address = thread.pubkey(),
    constraint = thread.id.eq("my_thread"),
    has_one = authority,
)]
pub thread: Account<'info, Thread>
```
